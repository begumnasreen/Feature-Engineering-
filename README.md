House Price Prediction

## price Prediction:

While searching for the dream house, the buyer looks at various
factors, not just the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity
to an east-west railroad.
Using the dataset, find the factors that influence price negotiations
while buying a house.
There are 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of
residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of cost for a house 

## Data Preprocessing:

1.	Understand the dataset:
a.	Identify the shape of the dataset
b.	Identify variables with null values
c.	Identify variables with unique values
2.	Generate a separate dataset for numerical and categorical variables
3.	EDA of numerical variables:
a.	Missing value treatment
b.	Identify the skewness and distribution
c.	Identify significant variables using a correlation matrix 
d.	Pair plot for distribution and density
4.	EDA of categorical variables
a.	Missing value treatment
b.	Count plot for bivariate analysis
c.	Identify significant variables using p-values and Chi-Square values
5.	Combine all the significant categorical and numerical variables
6.	Plot box plot for the new dataset to find the variables with outliers
Note: The last two points are performed to make the new dataset ready for training and prediction.
